# Terminal Wordle
A functioning game of Wordle that can be run in the console.

You are given a certain amount of guesses and need to type in a (typically) 5 letter word as a guess.
The program will let you know which letters are correct and in the right spot (colored green), which letters are in the word but not in the right spot (colored yellow), and which letters are not in the word (colored white).

## Testing
There are built in Unit Tests to test functions.
You can also alter the length of the word you want to guess and choose a test word if desired in the `wordle_runner.py` file.
